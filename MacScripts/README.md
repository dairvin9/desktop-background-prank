### FOR MACS

These scripts are written in the Applescript language, which, amoung other things, only works on Apple products. These scripts were tested with El Capitan and #workedForMe. If you want to change the picture or file location (I think you have to change the file location if you are gonna run it, actually) you willl have to make changes to recipe.txt. Basically copy the file into your AppleScriptEditor (search for it in Spotlight, it comes installed by default) and make your changes and hit the hammer button.
